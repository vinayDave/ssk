/**

/**
 * Logs the command type and command value for the Requesting, Requested and RequestCompleted events on a panel.
 * 
 * Note that this script will only attach once for a program instance and that it uses the instance cache
 * to check if an instance of this script has already been attached to the program instance. A script would 
 * normally detach all events on the controller when either the Requested or the RequestCompleted event if fired.
 * Since this script traces all requests for a program instance it will never detach the events and that is OK
 * in this scenario since the script will only attach once. There are scenarios were a real script would do the same
 * but this is not common, in most cases all events should be detached.
